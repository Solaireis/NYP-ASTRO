# NYP-ASTRO
A Web Development project which i have done in school

I chosen to do my a club website for my Astronomy Club to serve as an infopedia for club members to visit and to explore what astronomy club is about. 
Moreover, I realised in polytechnics, most CCA's do not have a dedicated website to act as a infopedia page for existing members and potential club members to visit.

I aim to make this website as a tribute for the many decades astronomy club has persisted in NYP!
